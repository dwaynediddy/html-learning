    <p id="words">Based on the key concept of ‘capturing the most pivotal moments of the Games and sharing these emotions,’ Canon will provide behind-the-scenes support to professional photographers from around the world via its loan services for cameras and lenses, and by providing a range of maintenance services.

        During the Tokyo 2020 Games, we will provide world-class services to sports journalists and photographers from all over the world who will gather in Japan to capture breath-taking images and historical performances of the world's top athletes. These images will immortalize the occasion, evoking memories and the wonderful spectacle of the Tokyo 2020 Games.
